# How to Build an AI-Powered Recommendation System

Welcome to the **How-to-Build-an-AI-powered-Recommendation-System** repository! ðŸŽ‰ 

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to building recommendation systems using two powerful approaches:

1. **Traditional Recommendation System in Python**
2. **Recommendation System using Cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs)**

The project is designed to help you understand and implement personalized recommendation systems while working with real-world datasets.
